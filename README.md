The code implements a React application using JavaScript and Vite, with the user interface components provided by Material-UI. The application has two pages: the first page is a form that collects the user's name, phone number, and email and saves the details in local storage. The second page displays a list of JSON data retrieved from an API, which is converted into a JavaScript model/interface and displayed in a table using the Material-UI Table component.

The tech stack used in this code includes:

React - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

JavaScript - A high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language.

Vite - A fast and optimized build tool for modern web development.

Material-UI - A popular React UI framework that implements Google's Material Design guidelines.

React Router DOM - A library for routing in React applications.

npm - A package manager for the JavaScript programming language.

This tech stack allows for the creation of a dynamic and responsive single-page application with a user-friendly interface, using the latest web development tools and techniques.


The first page component uses the useState hook to manage the state of the form inputs, and the useHistory hook from the react-router-dom library to handle navigation between pages. The form has input fields for the user's name, phone number, and email, and a submit button that saves the details in local storage and navigates to the second page. If the user attempts to access the second page without providing the necessary information, they are redirected back to the first page with a message indicating that they must enter their details.

The second page component uses the useEffect hook to fetch the data from the API, and the useState hook to manage the state of the data. The useEffect hook calls an asynchronous function that fetches the data and sets the state with the retrieved data. The data is displayed in a Material-UI table, with each row showing the ID, title, and body of a JSON object.

In summary, this code demonstrates how to create a simple React application that uses Material-UI components, collects user information, saves the details in local storage, fetches data from an API, converts the data into a JavaScript model, and displays the data in a table.
